#4.1.1.13-Deepcopy-LAB-2

###Estimated time

15 minutes

###Level of difficulty

Medium

###Objectives

•	improving the student's skills in creating classes representing candies;

•	improving the student's skills in operating with deepcopy() and copy.

###Scenario

The previous task was a very easy one. Now let's rework the code a bit:
1.	introduce the Delicacy class to represent a generic delicacy. The objects of this class will replace the old school dictionaries. Suggested attribute names: name, price, weight;
2.	your class should implement the __str__() method to represent each object state;
3.	experiment with the copy.copy() and deepcopy.copy() methods to see the difference in how each method copies objects .
