##Objectives

•	Improving the student's skills in creating decorators and operating with them.

##Scenario

•	Create a function decorator that prints a timestamp (in a form like year-month-day hour:minute:seconds, e.g. 2019-11-05 08:33:22)

•	Create a few ordinary functions that do some simple tasks, like adding or multiplying two numbers.

•	Apply your decorator to those functions to ensure that the time of the function executions can be monitored.
